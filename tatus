[33me97e73f[m Add automatic cleanup of existing sample fixtures - Added cleanupSampleFixtures method to remove fake Premier League data - Automatically deletes sample fixtures from old database structure when no real fixtures found - This prevents GW3-10 from showing Arsenal/Chelsea/Liverpool fake data - Only affects gameweeks without real fixtures, preserves real data in GW1-2
[33m566f8e5[m Disable automatic sample fixture creation to prevent fake Premier League data - Removed createSampleFixtures calls that were creating hardcoded Arsenal/Chelsea/Liverpool fixtures - Gameweeks without real fixtures now show empty state instead of fake data - This prevents confusion and preserves real imported fixtures - Sample fixtures were overwriting real data and showing wrong teams for National League
[33m79048b7[m Fix kick-off time and status showing as TBD in fixture cards - Updated field mapping to use correct database field names: 'time' instead of 'kickOffTime' - Added fallback for time field: fixtureData.time || fixtureData.kickOffTime - Improved status field handling to check status.short first, then status.status - Fixed deadline checking logic to use correct time field - Fixture cards should now display proper kick-off times and status instead of TBD
[33mde0431a[m Fix scores not displaying in fixtures despite being in database - Updated FixturesManager to check apiData field for scores when top-level scores are null - Scores stored in nested apiData.home-team.score and apiData.away-team.score are now properly extracted - This fixes the issue where scores exist in database but show as null in fixtures display - Both homeScore and awayScore now use fallback to apiData when top-level fields are empty
